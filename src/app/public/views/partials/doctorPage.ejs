                    There are some occasions, when healthcare professionals have to give advice in a sensitive manner.
                    Think of some of the times, when you have had to do this. What sorts of things were you discussing?
                </p>
                <p>
                    think about the language you might use in these situations. It is useful to have a ‘scale’ of
                    language in mind, when you are giving advice sensitively. In order to be effective, you will be
                    using several communication skills.

                <p class="info">
                    The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major effect on our lives. Many of us are facing challenges that can
                    be stressful, overwhelming, and cause strong emotions in adults and children. Public health actions,
                    such as social distancing, are necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19, but they can make us feel
                    isolated and lonely and can increase stress and anxiety. Learning to cope with stress in a healthy
                    way will make you, the people you care about, and those around you become more resilient.
                </p>
